# download-helpers-ahk
Auto hotkey scripts to download multiple files which normally require repeatively changing tabs.   
Note: I know the files are named weirdly, I may change them later.

## Prerequisites
Install autohotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/. Autohotkey is only supported on Windows (to my knowledge).

## Usage
### download help.ahk
**Great tool for downloading multiple files that have the download button at the same spot on multiple pages. It supports automatic tab closing as well.**
The instructions in the message boxes are clear enough.

### Download.ahk
**This is an older version of _download help.ahk_.**
Hover the mouse cursor over the download button, then _Ctrl + shift + enter_ to save the location of a download button.   
Press _Enter_ to automatically click that spot and automatically presses enter after one second.   


### File number renamer.ahk
**Automatically renames every file or folder "1" up to the number you enter into the input box prompt.**
Select the first file in the list. Then _Shift + F2_. Enter the number of files/folders you want to rename and click enter.
